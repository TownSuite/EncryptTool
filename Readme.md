A simple tool that can encrypt a string value that is passed in and prints to the console.

# Arguments

* "string value"
* use hash
* "thekey"

# Examples

```bash
EncryptTool.exe "I will be encrypted" "true" "I am the encryption key"
```

The above encrypts using a hash.

```bash
EncryptTool.exe "I will be encrypted" "false" "I am the encryption key"
```

The above encrypts without using a hash.
